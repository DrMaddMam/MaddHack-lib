A simple non-heap memory library for optimized applications
to use:
    to get memory:
        specified type* var = (specified type*)getMem(amount);
        or
        specified type* var = (specified type*)getMem(amount)->location;
        or
        struct mem_part* var = getMem(amount); if you're a pussy
        and use var->location;
    to mark memory as unused, reuseable:
        freeMem(ptr)
    you can also change maximum memory size with
        #define BLOCK_LIST_SIZE_REPLACE
        #define BLOCK_LIST_SIZE {multiple of 8}
    or directly change the block size, default is (BLOCK_LIST_SIZE * 8)
        #define BLOCK_SIZE_REPLACE
        #define BLOCK_SIZE {multiple of 64}
    if you ever want to max out the BLOCK use +OVERHEAD or -OVERHEAD
        getMem(BLOCK_SIZE_FUNCTIONAL);
        and youll have about 127 extra, but not really, just dont mess with the alignment or everything explodes
